# Simple Request Response Layer

Simple Request Response Layer (or SRRL, pronounced "surreal") is a framework built for service oriented architectures. It can be used to assemble pages made up of individual modules, each of which making it's own web service call in parallel with the others, and assemble the final result. The framework can also be used to build the web services which power such modules.
